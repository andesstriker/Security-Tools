# Security-Tools
I have been researching what are the best security tools through online resources and books. I will try to keep all the documentation updated. Follow the contributing.md if you want to add anything.Look around my repo for recommendations and also some basic tools I have made. Any questions feel free to reach out to me at andesstriker@gmail.com. 

There are also some general techniques on how to solve some problems based on my experiences.
